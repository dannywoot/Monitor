Command-line Guide for Document Monitor Script

This script monitors a specified document for changes and records the updates along with the time of the modification in a report file. 

Here is a guide for the command-line options:

1. --document_path: Specify the path to the document to monitor. Include the full path to the document, including the document's filename and extension. This option is required.
   Example: --document_path "C:\path\to\your\document.txt"

2. --interval: Specify how often the script checks the document for changes, in seconds. This option is optional and defaults to 10 seconds if not specified.
   Example: --interval 15

3. --report_path: Specify where to save the report that the script generates. Include the full path to the location, including the desired filename and extension for the report. This option is required.
   Example: --report_path "C:\path\to\your\report.txt"

To run the script, open a command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and enter a command like:

python document_monitor.py --document_path "C:\path\to\your\document.txt" --interval 15 --report_path "C:\path\to\your\report.txt"

Replace "C:\path\to\your\document.txt" with the path to the document you want to monitor, 15 with your desired interval in seconds, and "C:\path\to\your\report.txt" with the path to your report file.

To stop the script, press Ctrl+C in the command prompt.
